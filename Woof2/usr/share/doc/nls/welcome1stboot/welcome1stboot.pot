"A 'partition' is known by a drive letter in dos/windows, such as C:, D:, but "
"Linux uses a more rigorous naming scheme, such as sda1, sda2. If you are "
"unfamiliar with these different types of partitions (and the Linux naming), "
"don't worry, as Puppy will automatically detect and offer you a choice of "
"suitable partitions in which to save the session. Puppy will only create a "
"single file in the partition and this will not affect your current "
"installation of Windows (but of course we have to make a full disclaimer of "
"any responsibility if something does go wrong!) and next time you boot Puppy "
"from CD the save-file will get automatically read -- so, there is really no "
"need to install Puppy onto the hard drive, and you can just keep booting "
"Puppy from CD indefinitely."

"hard drive, or any plugin drive (USB Flash pen drive for example)."
